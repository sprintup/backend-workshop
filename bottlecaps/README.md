# Bottlecaps

Bottlecaps is a social networking app to practice back end development.

I followed this [tutorial](http://portlandcodeschool.github.io/jse/2015/09/14/sep14-backbone1/) and this [tutorial](http://portlandcodeschool.github.io/jse/2015/09/16/sep16-backbone2/)

Things I learned include:

-event handlers
-$(document).ready();
