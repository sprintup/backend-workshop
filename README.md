## Welcome to my Backend Development Workshop 

Similar to my frontend development workshop, this is where I learn about new technologies, break them and fix them. 

### Things I've learned include:

* removing staged files in git
* git [submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)
* [backbone $el](http://backbonejs.org/#View-$el)
* backbone [mv](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-View-separation)-[c](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-Collections)
* [Learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)

### Todo
* Testing using npm .json as per [this](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/building-a-mean-application/introduction-to-the-mean-stack/setting-up-an-express-application)
* Email routing for product pages
