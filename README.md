## Welcome to my Backend Development Workshop

* git [submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)
* [backbone $el](http://backbonejs.org/#View-$el)
* backbone [mv](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-View-separation)-[c](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-Collections)
* [Learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)
* [Mongo](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/api/)
